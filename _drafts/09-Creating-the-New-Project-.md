# Creating the New Project 

Now that you have seen what you are going to build, dive right in and
get the project up and running.

As I said earlier, before I start any new Ionic project, I want to make
sure I am on the latest Ionic CLI. Do that first.

Run these commands

> npm install -g \@ionic/cli@latest
>
> ionic start

When asked, select Angular as the framework. Next, supply the name of
the project. I chose "a10dance." Select the blank template for this one.
You will be implementing a side menu, but I would rather have us build
it from scratch. Besides, this way you will be cutting a lot less
boilerplate code.

If you are asked about Capacitor integration, say no. If it does not
ask, but enables it automatically, that is fine.

You will not be working with AppFlow, so answer no to the question about
connecting it to an Ionic account.

Once the project is created, you can open it in the IDE to have a look.
There is not much there, because you used the blank template. That is
OK, because you will build it up quickly.

Go back into the terminal and fire up a quick command:

> ionic serve

Take a look at how it renders.

Again, there is not much content to speak of. So, take care of that
next.
