## Demo Application

This section is designed as a continuation of the last section, so feel
free to use the demo application you just built. If you skipped that
first section, or simply want to follow along, you can use one of the
following projects.

<https://github.com/walkingriver/at10dance-angular>

<https://github.com/walkingriver/at10dance-react>

Simply clone one of these repositories and then execute

> npm install

inside the generated folder. You will need Node 8 or later, which you
can find at <http://nodejs.org>.

If you decide to clone one of my repos, use one the following blocks of
commands to get you up and running quickly:

### Clone and Build the Angular Version

> git clone <https://github.com/walkingriver/at10dance-angular.git>
>
> npm install
>
> npm run build

### Clone and Build the React Version

> git clone <https://github.com/walkingriver/at10dance-react.git>
>
> npm install
>
> npm run build

Note: These two repositories are for the demo application from my Ionic
"Idea to App Store" series.
