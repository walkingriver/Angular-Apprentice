# A10Dance - The Demo App

The application you will be building throughout the course is called
A10Dance. It is an attendance application originally designed to help
Sunday School teachers keep track of the students in their classes.

For this book, the app will consist of three pages:

-   A home page

-   A Student Roster page

-   A Student Detail page

A side menu will enable users easily navigate between the home and
student roster pages. You will review how the menu is built, and
navigation is configured to move from page to page.

The home page is where the application will start. There is not much
here but an ion-card component. I will use this component to display
some text information about the application.

The Roster page displays the students registered to the class and has
most of the Ionic components you will use. The students are collectively
displayed using an ion-list, with each list item consisting of
ion-items, ion-buttons, ion-icons, and more. You will spend most of our
time in the section covering this page, as you flesh out its
functionality with action sheets, alerts, and toast notifications.

Finally, the Student detail page is where you can view and edit various
details about a single student. You will eventually use this page to
discuss Ionic forms. In this chapter, all you will do is lay out the
components and bind some data to them.

At each step of the way, I will explain the components I have selected,
and then provide the code that implements them.
