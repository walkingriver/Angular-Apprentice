# Wrap Up

Congratulations! In this book, you managed to build an App Store version
of a web application using Ionic's Capacitor.

You saw the application run on a real device and on the iOS simulator.

Then you successfully created and uploaded the application to Apple's
App Store Connect.

You created some custom icons and splash screens, making the app look
more normal, more natural.

You used the iOS Simulator to create the required App Store screenshots
at various resolutions.

And finally, if all went well, you submitted the app to the App Store
for approval.

If you have been following along, you should now have everything you
need to get your own application submitted to the App Store and
hopefully approved.
