# Where to Go from Here?

I hope you enjoyed this introduction to developing web applications with
Ionic and Angular. By this point, you should be comfortable with:

-   The basics of the Ionic Framework.

-   Some of the "Angularisms" and how they work with Ionic.

-   Looking for more information in the [Ionic
    Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs).

-   Building a functional UI composed of various Ionic Components.

This is Volume One in the series: *Ionic and Angular: Idea to App
Store*. Please look for the other volumes in this series.

## Ionic and Angular Video Course

I mentioned this before, but it bears repeating. There is also an online
video version of this course, encompassing this entire book series.
