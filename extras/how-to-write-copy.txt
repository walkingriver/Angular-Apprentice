How to Write a High Converting Gumroad Landing Page

If you’re considering launching something…you’re probably feeling confused and overwhelmed with all the marketing advice out there. At the same time, you want your product to sell well and make a nice income for yourself. 

Being a creator is tough, am I right?

I’ve got you covered. This guide takes my experience writing Gumroad pages that are proven to convert and gives you actionable advice that you can apply (immediately) without having to read 10 marketing books or struggle to prompt ChatGPT into a half decent landing page. 

This guide is written with the impression that you have

A product (or an idea) you want to market on Gumroad
You’re a creator. You have minimal knowledge of marketing and want to get it done as fast and as easily as you can
Let’s get started:

1) Start with your market

Here’s the first thing you need to understand: Most creators make the fatal mistake of starting with their product. When you’re creating a product…you tend to lose sight of the customer. That’s completely natural and to be expected. But when you’re creating marketing for a product…it’s time to remove your “creator hat” and get into the shoes of your customers. 

Most creators will dive straight into listing features and benefits and lay out their entire course/info product like it’s a high school curriculum. 

Who wants to go back to high school and study? Not me. You’d be turning potential customers off before they even check out your product.  

What’s the right way, then?

You need to spend some time understanding your market. Your target. As well as you can. Even if it takes a while and sounds boring. Even if you think you “have a fair idea”.

It will be well worth it. 

When I wrote my first $100k Gumroad page (in 2 days!)…you’d think I spent hours perfecting every word of copy. Nuh-uh. I spent an entire day (That’s half of the time I had) just understanding the market. How? I’ll cover that in the next step. 

2) Do some research

Now you know how important it is to understand your market. But how does that look in reality? How do you actually do it?

Go where your audience hangs out online. I’m talking about Reddit (my personal favorite), Facebook groups, X, discord servers, YouTube comments, amazon reviews of similar products.

Look for patterns. What are they constantly complaining about? What solutions are they looking for? What language do they use?

People pour their hearts out online like they’re writing a diary entry (or their high school essay). You’ll find gold in these places.

(Please do not use ChatGPT for this. It can sometimes hallucinate and make stuff up…or paraphrase things that are important. You want to read these directly from the source)

Here’s what you’re looking for specifically:

Pain points (What is keeping them up at night?)
Desired outcomes (What do they really want?)
Objections (What makes them hesitate?)
Language patterns (How do they talk about their problems? Do they use any specific words?)
I make notes of everything. Especially the exact phrases they use – these will come in handy when writing your page. Marketing to GenZ is a whole lot different than marketing to old men is a whole lot different than marketing to young couples. You need to understand how they think and how they speak. 

For example, when I wrote that $100k page, I spent hours on Reddit reading about people’s frustrations with their 9-5 jobs and their search for side hustles. The patterns were clear:

They wanted something that didn’t require years of learning
They needed quick results
They were skeptical of “get rich quick” schemes
They wanted proof it would work
This research gave me direction and clarity on how I should market my product.

3) Follow a proven structure

Now that you understand your market, it’s time to write your page. But where do you start?

Here’s the structure I’ve used to generate multiple six figures on Gumroad:

The Hook

This is your headline + first few lines. It needs to stop them from scrolling. Period.

Don’t try to be clever here. Use what you learned in your research. 

What’s the ONE THING your target audience wants more than anything else?

For example, in my $100k page, I used: 

“HOW A STAY AT HOME DAD MADE 358K IN 2019 FIXING BROKEN ELECTRONICS (And you can, too!)”

Why did this work?

“Stay at home dad” → Shows it’s possible even with limited time
“358k” → Big promise, but not unbelievable
“fixing broken electronics” → Sounds simple, not technical
“(And you can, too!)” → Creates immediate possibility
The Problem

Right after your hook, agitate the problem. Use the EXACT words and phrases you found in your research. Show them you understand their struggles.

For example: “Tired of watching life pass by while you build someone else’s dream? Working 60-hour weeks just to barely keep up with inflation?”

Why this works:

“watching life pass by” → Emotional trigger
“someone else’s dream” → Common frustration
“60-hour weeks” → Specific, relatable detail
Questions create nodding agreement
The Solution (Your Product)

Now introduce your solution. But here’s the key – don’t just list features. Tell them what transformation each feature will create in their life.

For example: “The Side Hustle Blueprint: Your Complete System to Go from Overworked Employee to Independent Business Owner in 90 Days”

Why this works:

“Blueprint” → Implies step-by-step system
“Complete System” → Promises everything needed
“90 Days” → Specific time frame creates clarity
“Overworked Employee to Independent Business Owner” → Clear transformation
Proof

Show them it works. For example: “Join 1,247 students who quit their 9-5 in 2023 Average first month revenue: $2,834 Youngest success story: 19 years old Oldest success story: 67 years old”

Why this works:

Specific numbers → More believable than round figures
Range of results → Shows it works for everyone
Multiple metrics → Creates complete picture
Real data → Builds trust
I’ll cover this in more detail in the next section.

The Offer

What exactly are they getting? Be specific. List everything.

For example: “Complete Business Launch System ($997 value)

12 Weekly Group Coaching Calls ($1,997 value)
Done-for-You Marketing Templates ($497 value)
Private Community Access ($397 value)”
Why this works:

Clear components → Easy to understand
Specific values → Shows total worth
Multiple pieces → Increases perceived value
Support included → Reduces fear of failure
Bonus Tip: Use Bonuses strategically. People tend to read the bonus section, so make it worth their while and make sure to highlight a specific solution to their problem (or a fast and easy way to get their money’s worth.)

Have a refund policy (Risk Reversal)

If someone has read up to this point in your landing page…they’re considering buying. All you need to do is nudge them ever so slightly and reaffirm their subconscious decision to buy. Remove all risk. Guarantee. Support. Anything and Everything that makes them feel safe.

A good refund policy can double your conversions without any extra effort. And EVEN if a few people ask for a refund…you’ll end up making more money in total.

CTA

What’s a CTA? It means “Call-to-Action”. It’s exactly what it sounds like – prompting the customer to take action. In this case, to buy your product.

You need to tell the reader exactly what to do next. You would think that the average person knows to click on the buy now button and add their card details. But that’s not true. You need to be extremely specific and explain exactly what they need to do next. It can be as simple as saying “Click BUY NOW to get this product”. 

This is a simple, proven structure that has been tried and tested multiple times. Even if you don’t know ANYTHING about marketing or copywriting…this can help you create a great landing page (or 10X conversions on your current one!).

4) Make Your Product Sound GREAT

Here’s where most creators mess up – they try to sound professional. Academic. Formal.

Stop it.

Write like you talk. Imagine you’re explaining your product to a friend at a coffee shop.

Some rules I follow:

Short sentences. Like this one.
Use conversational language
Break up long paragraphs
Bold the important stuff
Add personality (Yes, emojis are fine if that’s your style)
But here’s the real secret to making your product sound great: 

Focus on transformation, not information.

Don’t say: “12 modules on iPhone repair techniques” 

Say: “By week 2, you’ll complete your first repair and make your first $100”

See the difference?

5) Add strategic social proof

Social proof isn’t just about throwing testimonials on your page. It’s about using the right proof at the right time. There are different types of “proof” that increase trust, and I’m going to give you a few examples. 

When you’re starting out…you might not have all of these. That’s fine. Make do with what you have. 

Showcase early wins: Show small, achievable results first “Made my first $100 in week 1! Lost 5 lbs without feeling restricted!
Big results to back up your promises: While it may not be possible for everyone…people love to see what’s “possible”.  Testimonials like “I quit my job after 6 months” or “I was able to code a complex app like this in X days” or “ I was able to land my dream job and now earn XX” or “I was able to pay off my mortgage” inspires people and pushes them to action.
Address objections with proof: Use testimonials that address common objections. Think of 10 excuses your prospective customer would give himself and try to answer as many as you can  
“I was worried about finding clients, but followed the exact outreach template and got 3 clients in my first week”

“I’ve always been an introvert but I was able to make friends with your course”

Pro tip: Don’t just dump all your testimonials in one place. Sprinkle them throughout your page where they’re most relevant. If someone shares a long block of text as a review…make sure you are highlighting the relevant parts. NO ONE wants to read a huge block of text. 

And if you don’t have any of these (we all start somewhere!)…here are some things you can use instead:

People talking positively about you
Your own success and the results you’ve gotten for yourself
Clear before-after of using your product
Any other numbers or credentials that showcase you as an authority
The sheer market size and possibilities (Example: The iPhone repair industry is X million per year)
Get creative. How can you get external sources to reaffirm everything you’ve said? 

ANYTHING is better than having NO proof. Find something and make it work until you have your first few testimonials. If you’re starting from absolute scratch, you can give a few copies of your product for free and ask people to give you a (honest) testimonial in exchange. 

6) How to use Gumroad’s features to your advantage

While gumroad does not have a fancy page builder…it has some powerful tools that you can use to your advantage. 

Cover Image

Keep it simple. Really simple.

Clear text
One strong promise
Clean design (No one ever lost a sale because their cover wasn’t fancy enough)
Here’s a good cover image:


(Coincidentally, it’s his best selling product out of 10 other products!)

Pricing Strategy

Gumroad lets you create different pricing tiers. Use them.

Basic: Core product
Premium: Core + exclusive bonuses
VIP: Everything + personal support
This helps you test multiple price points and understand which one is working best.  

Here are 11 tips that will INSTANTLY help you write better copy:

People don’t care about you. Or your product. Or your service. They care about what you can do for them.
Emotion > Logic. People buy on emotion and justify with logic.
Don’t be boring. If you’re bored writing it, they’re bored reading it.
Stories help. It’s how humans are wired to learn and remember. Use impactful stories wherever you can. 
Write for your best prospect – the person most likely to buy from you. 
The more specific, the better. Vague promises = vague results = no sales.
Get them to buy now, not later. Introduce some urgency in your copy. It can be with discounts, or with limited spots. A good product would have urgency built in (Example: This stock market opportunity will be gone by next week) 
Benefits > Features. “Get your first client in 7 days” beats “12 modules of client acquisition strategies”
Don’t care about the length of the copy. People will read what interests them.
Better to be different than better. Stand out or get lost in the noise.
And the most important tip of all:

Figuring out the best marketing for your product is all about using the best practices well…and then testing and iterating based on results. 

The first version of your copy might not be great…but if you keep trying new things…you’ll eventually end up with a great sales page that will print cash for a long, long time.
