# A10Dance - The Demo App

Throughout the rest of this book, we'll be building an application called
A10Dance. It is an attendance application originally designed to help
Sunday School teachers keep track of the students in their classes.

Our application will consist of three pages:

-   A home page

-   A Student Roster page

-   A Student Detail page

We'll implement a side  menu to enable easy navigation between the home and
student roster pages. Together, we'll explore how the menu is built using Material's
sidenav component, and how navigation is configured to move from page to page.

The home page is where our application will start. There isn't much
here but a Material card component. We'll use this component to display
some text information about the application.

The Roster page displays the students registered to the class and showcases
most of the Material components we'll use. The students are collectively
displayed using Material's data table, with each row consisting of
Material buttons, icons, and more. We'll spend most of our
time in this section, as we flesh out its
functionality with dialog boxes, snackbar notifications, and Material's
interactive features.

Finally, the Student detail page is where we can view and edit various
details about a single student. We'll use this page to explore
Material's form components. In this chapter, we'll focus on laying out the
components and binding data to them.

At each step of the way, we'll examine the components we've selected,
and then implement the code that brings them to life.
