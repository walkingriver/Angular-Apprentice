# Bonus Chapter 3: Full-Stack Deployment

Now that we have both a frontend and backend for A10Dance, let's explore how to deploy a full-stack application. We'll cover different hosting options and best practices for production deployment.

## Choosing a Backend Host

### Popular Options
1. Heroku
2. Railway
3. Render
4. DigitalOcean
5. AWS (Advanced)

We'll use Railway for this guide due to its:
- Generous free tier
- Easy deployment process
- Built-in PostgreSQL support
- Automatic HTTPS

## Preparing for Production

### Backend Preparation
1. Environment variables
2. Production configurations
3. Security headers
4. Logging setup
5. Database configuration

### Frontend Updates
1. Environment configuration
2. API URL configuration
3. Error handling
4. Loading states

## Deploying the Backend

### Railway Deployment
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Environment Setup
1. Database URL
2. API keys
3. CORS settings
4. Port configuration

## Connecting Frontend and Backend

### Environment Configuration
```typescript
// environment.prod.ts
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'https://your-api.railway.app'
};
```

### CORS Configuration
```typescript
// backend/src/server.ts
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://your-frontend.netlify.app'
}));
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Backend Monitoring
1. Error tracking
2. Performance monitoring
3. Database monitoring
4. Log management

### Frontend Monitoring
1. Error tracking
2. Performance metrics
3. User analytics
4. Console monitoring

## Deployment Pipeline

1. Continuous Integration setup
2. Automated testing
3. Staging environment
4. Production deployment
5. Rollback procedures

## Security Considerations

1. SSL/TLS setup
2. API security
3. Database security
4. File upload security
5. Environment variables

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. CORS errors
2. Database connection issues
3. Environment variable problems
4. Build failures
5. Runtime errors

## Best Practices

1. Use staging environments
2. Implement health checks
3. Set up monitoring
4. Configure automated backups
5. Document deployment procedures

## Next Steps

- Setting up CI/CD
- Adding custom domains
- Implementing CDN
- Database optimization
- Scaling strategies
