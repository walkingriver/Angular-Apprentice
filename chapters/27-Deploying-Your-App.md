# Deploying Your Angular Application

Now that we've built our A10Dance app, it's time to share it with the world. In this chapter, we'll:

1. Prepare our app for production
2. Build the application with production settings
3. Choose a hosting platform
4. Set up continuous deployment
5. Configure environment variables
6. Monitor our deployed application

We'll walk through deploying both our Angular frontend and Node.js backend to ensure our app runs smoothly in production.
