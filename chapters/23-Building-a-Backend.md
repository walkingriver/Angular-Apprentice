# Building a Simple Backend Service

So far, we've been working with mock data in our A10Dance app. In this chapter, we'll create a simple Node.js/Express backend service to:

1. Store our student data
2. Handle attendance records
3. Manage file uploads for student photos
4. Provide a RESTful API for our Angular frontend

We'll also explore how to use Angular's HttpClient to communicate with our backend service.
