# A Brief History of Angular


Angular has come a long way since its inception as AngularJS in 2010. This chapter will briefly explore where it started and where it is today. This history helps explain why Angular is structured the way it is today, and why certain design decisions were made along the way. If you aren't interested in this history, feel free to skip it. I won't be offended. 

Angular has enjoyed someone of a rennaissance in recent years, mostly from the introduction of standalone components, which were first introduced in Angular 14 as a preview feature. The sudden explosion in new features and improved developer experience has made Angular a favorite among developers.  why it is where it is today.

## AngularJS (Version 1.x) - 2010
AngularJS revolutionized web development when it was released by Google in 2010. It introduced two-way data binding, dependency injection, and directives, making it possible to build dynamic web applications with less code. The framework's use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and its ability to extend HTML with custom attributes made it immensely popular.

However, it was limited in its capabilities and had a steep learning curve. It was also not as performant as its successor, which would simply be called Angular.

## Angular 2 - September 2016
In September 2016, Google released Angular 2, a complete rewrite of AngularJS. This version:
- Switched to TypeScript for better tooling and type safety. As we'll see later, TypeScript is a key component of Angular.
- Introduced a component-based architecture that allowed for better reusability and maintainability.
- Added improved performance through ahead-of-time compilation.
- Provided better mobile support.
- Implemented a new templating syntax.

The decision to rewrite the entire framework from the ground up, but still refer to it as Angular, was a controversial one. To this day, many people still refer to Angular as AngularJS. Some have suggested it should have been called AngularTS or AngularIO (the original web site was angular.io). Some said they should have gone with an entirely different name. 

Things got worse in April 2022, when Google announced that it was shutting down AngularJS. People thought they meant to shut down Angular. I know a lot of teams heard that and suddenly refused to start any new projects in Angular due to this misunderstanding.

## Angular 3 - Skipped
Version 3 was skipped to align with the router package version. It took a lot of folks by surprise, but probably not as much as keeping the Angular name for version 2.
