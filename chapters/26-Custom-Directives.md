# Creating Custom Directives

While components are the most common type of directive in Angular, there are other types that can help us reuse behavior across our app. In this chapter, we'll:

1. Understand structural and attribute directives
2. Create custom directives for our A10Dance app
3. Learn about directive lifecycle hooks
4. Pass data to directives using inputs
5. Handle events in directives

We'll create directives for common patterns in our app, like handling hover states and managing permissions.
