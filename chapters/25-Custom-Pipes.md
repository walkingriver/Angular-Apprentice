# Working with Angular Pipes

Pipes are a powerful feature in Angular for transforming data in our templates. In this chapter, we'll:

1. Understand Angular's built-in pipes
2. Create custom pipes for our A10Dance app
3. Learn about pure and impure pipes
4. Use async pipes with Observables
5. Chain multiple pipes together

We'll create some useful pipes for formatting student names, dates, and attendance status.
