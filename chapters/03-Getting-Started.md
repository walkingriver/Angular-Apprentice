# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To begin, ensure you have a robust text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I recommend **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:

- **VS Code** is free, open-source, and designed to work seamlessly with web technologies including Angular and Angular Material. It supports extensions for enhanced functionality.
- Feel free to use any editor or IDE you're comfortable with, but make sure it supports JavaScript and TypeScript well, as Angular uses TypeScript.

## Software Tools

To develop and deploy an Angular application using Angular Material, you'll need to configure your environment with:

- **Node.js**

  - Node.js serves as the runtime for your JavaScript and TypeScript code. Opt for the **LTS (Long-Term Support) version** for stability.

- **npm (Node Package Manager)**

  - npm is automatically installed with Node.js and manages the dependencies of your project.

- **Git**

  - Essential for version control. If you're on a Mac or Linux, Git might already be installed. For Windows, download from the official Git website.

- **Angular CLI**
  - Install globally via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
  - The Angular CLI helps you to create, develop, and maintain Angular applications easily.

Most of these tools will need configuration based on your operating system.
