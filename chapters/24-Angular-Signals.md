# Understanding Angular Signals

Signals are Angular's new reactive primitive for managing state. In this chapter, we'll:

1. Understand what Signals are and why they matter
2. Learn how to create and use Signals
3. Compare Signals with RxJS Observables
4. Explore computed Signals and Signal effects
5. Refactor parts of our A10Dance app to use Signals

We'll see how Signals can make our state management more intuitive and performant.
